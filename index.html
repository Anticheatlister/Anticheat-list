            <a href="https://Polar.ac"> <h1>Polar is known to be the best anticheat in most scenarios but the servers run on hopes and dreams and is so expensive hycraft loses it half of the time because they can't pay their license in time :sob:</h1> </a>

            <h1 style="color: red;">Client's I recommend using:</h1>
            <a href="https://liquidbounce.net"> <h1>LiquidBounce nextgen/legacy. Nextgen can bypass polar and a lot more and legacy is better for more basic anticheats but still can bypass strict anticheats!</h1> </a>
            <a href="https://stitch.best"> <h1>Stitch is a paid client and is basically the best multiserver client for beginners and learners</h1></a>
            <a href="https://spezz.exchange/store/product/191-augustus-client-lifetime/"> <h1>Augustus is the best multiserver client and is priced at a really high price and is not recommended for people who do not know how to config it as it's hard to learn but if you can learn it I would highly recommend it!</h1> </a>
